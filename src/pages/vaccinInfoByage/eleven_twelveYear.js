                Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that can cause
                several cancers in men and women. Although typically given to
                children ages 11-12 years, the HPV vaccine can be given as early
                as 9 years old to help protect them against cancers caused by
                HPV infection. For best protection, most children this age will
                need two shots of the HPV vaccine, 6-12 months apart.

                Flu is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Flu
                spreads easily and can cause serious illness, especially in
                children younger than 5 years and children of any age with
                certain chronic conditions including asthma. Everyone 6 months
                of age and older should get a flu vaccine every year ideally by
                the end of October.

                Meningococcal disease can refer to any illness caused by a type
                of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. These bacteria can
                cause meningococcal meningitis or bloodstream infections, which
                can be serious, even deadly. The meningococcal vaccine called
                MenACWY helps protect against four types of the bacteria that
                causes meningococcal disease (serogroups A, C, W, and Y).

                A Tdap booster shot protects older children from three serious
                diseasesâ€”diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis).
                While people of any age in the United States can get all three
                of these potentially deadly diseases, whooping cough is most
                common. Preteens and teens who get whooping cough may cough for
                10 weeks or more, possibly leading to rib fractures from severe
                coughing.
