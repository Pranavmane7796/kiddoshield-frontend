            Flu is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Flu
            spreads easily and can cause serious illness, especially in children
            younger than 5 years and children of any age with certain chronic
            conditions including asthma. Everyone 6 months of age and older
            should get a flu vaccine every year ideally by the end of October.
